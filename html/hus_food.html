    <p>Hey there, two-legged snow buddy! I'm your frosty-cool Husky, and I've got some snowy advice to keep my food bowl howling with delight! Let's sled through the do's and dont's of my Arctic-inspired diet. Ready to mush on? Let's dig in!</p>

  <p>  <h1>DO's</h1>
<ul>
  <li>Top-notch chow time! Gimme that high-quality dog food that keeps my energy as boundless as the tundra!</li>
  <li>Tasty treats? Oh, fur sure! But keep 'em in moderation, or I'll have more rolls than a snowman!</li>
  <li>Veggies are ice-mazing! Carrots, peas, and sweet potatoes make me feel like a true northern explorer!</li>
  <li>Omega-3, nom-nom time! Salmon and fish oils make my fluffy coat shine like the Northern Lights!</li>
  <li>Keep the water flowing, like a free-flowing stream! Hydration is key to keeping me frosty and fit!</li>
</ul>

  <div class="food1">
  <p>  <h1>DONT's</h1>
<ul>
  <li>Howl no to chocolate! It's like eating snow that's been yellow-marked, and that's just not cool, man!</li>
  <li>Spicy chow is a frigid "no-no"! No hot sauce, chili, or peppers – my Arctic belly can't handle the heat!</li>
  <li>Human nibbles aren't Arctic-approved! No table scraps from your igloo, please – I need my special fuel!</li>
  <li>Ice-cold grapes and raisins are forbidden! They're like frostbite for my health, and that's icy scary!</li>
  <li>Ice cream dreams? Oh, doggos, no! Dairy's not my polar partner, and it leaves my tummy in a chilly churn!"Ice cream" sounds like "nice dream," but dairy is not my best friend. It leaves me feeling ruff!</li>
</ul>
