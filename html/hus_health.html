  <p>  <h1>GENERAL HEALTH</h1>
<ul>
  <li>Woof! Keep me active and provide regular exercise to maintain my muscular and healthy physique.</li>
  <li>Arf! Groom my thick double coat regularly to prevent matting and maintain skin health.</li>
  <li>Bark! Provide a balanced and high-quality diet to support my energy levels and overall well-being.</li>
  <li>Ruff! Keep me well-hydrated, especially during hot weather, to avoid overheating.</li>
  <li>Howl! Regular veterinary check-ups are a must to catch any health issues early and keep me in top shape.</li>

  <p>  <h1>DEVIATION FROM GENERAL HEALTH</h1>
<ul>
  <li>Grrr! Watch out for signs of hip dysplasia, a common issue in Huskies due to their genetics.</li>
  <li>Yip! Obesity can be a problem, so control my food portions and avoid excessive treats.</li>
  <li>Arroo! Keep me away from extreme heat, as my thick coat makes me susceptible to heatstroke.</li>
  <li>Sniff! Watch for eye problems like cataracts and progressive retinal atrophy.</li>
  <li>Whine! Be cautious about heartworms and other parasites, regular prevention is crucial.</li>
</ul>
</p>
  </div>
<br>
<br>

  <div class="health1">
  <p>  <h1>PRECAUTIONS</h1>
<ul>
  <li>Bark! Provide plenty of mental and physical stimulation to prevent boredom and destructive behavior.</li>
  <li>Woof! Never leave me off-leash in an unsecured area, as my independent nature might lead me to wander off.</li>
  <li>Arf! Protect me from extreme cold temperatures; I might enjoy it, but it can still be dangerous.</li>
  <li>Howl! Regularly check and clean my ears to avoid infections.</li>
  <li>Grrr! Secure your fences and gates, as I am an escape artist and love to explore.</li>
</ul>
</p>
  </div>
  <br>
  <br>

  <div class="health1">
  <p>  <h1>CURES</h1>
  <ul>
  <li>Sniff! If I'm feeling down, take me for a walk, and we'll howl at the moon together!</li>
  <li>Yip! Provide me with puzzle toys to stimulate my brain and keep me entertained.</li>
  <li>Arroo! Help me shed excess energy with interactive playtime and agility exercises.</li>
  <li>Whine! If I'm feeling itchy, a soothing oatmeal bath will be pawsitively delightful.</li>
  <li>Ruff! Most importantly, shower me with love, belly rubs, and tasty treats, and I'll be back to my cheerful self in no time!</li>
