    <p>Hey there, human friend! It's me, your lovable Labrador, here to dish out some tasty tips on what I love and what I totally pawsitively can't stomach in my food bowl! So, let's get wagging with the do's and dont's of my diet:</p>

  </div>
  <table>

  <div class="container">
  <div class="food1">
  <p>  <h1>DO's</h1>
<ul>
  <li>Gimme that drool-worthy premium kibble! I want those crunchy bites that make my taste buds dance with joy.</li>
  <li>Treats? Oh, yes, please! But keep 'em in moderation, or I'll turn into a real-life furry blimp!</li>
  <li>Veggies are not my arch-nemesis. Carrots, peas, and green beans? Bring 'em on for a nutritious crunch!</li>
  <li>Lean proteins? Woof, yeah! Chicken, turkey, and fish make me go barking mad with delight!</li>
  <li>Stay hydrated, my friend! Fresh water is the elixir of life, and I slurp it down like there's no tomorrow.</li>
</ul>
</p>
  </div>

  <div class="food1">
  <p>  <h1>DONT's</h1>
<ul>
  <li>No, no, no to chocolate! It's like kryptonite to me, and it's downright dangerous. Keep it away!</li>
  <li>Spicy stuff is a big "na-paw-litan" for me. No hot sauce, chili, or spicy peppers, please!</li>
  <li>I'm a Labrador, not a trash can! Don't toss your table scraps my way. They're not good for my tummy.</li>
  <li>Grapes and raisins are a big "Nuh-uh!" They can lead to some serious troubles for my health.</li>
  <li>"Ice cream" sounds like "nice dream," but dairy is not my best friend. It leaves me feeling ruff!</li>
</ul>
