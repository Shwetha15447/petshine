  <li>"Zoomie Madness": Let me sprint around the house like a tiny tornado, it's my daily cardio dose!</li>
  <li>"Pom Pom Push-Ups": I'll show off my upper body strength by playfully pushing up with my tiny paws.</li>
  <li>"Tail-Wagging Dance Party": Dancing to my favorite tunes, shaking my fluffy tail is a great way to burn some calories.</li></li>
  <li>"Toy Tug-of-War": Engage in a friendly tug-of-war battle with my favorite toys - it's good for my jaws and lots of fun!</li>
  <li>"Stairway to Heaven": Climb the stairs like a champ and get those little legs moving.</li>
