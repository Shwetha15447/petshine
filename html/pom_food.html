    <p>Hey there, tiny human with a big heart! I'm your pint-sized Pomeranian, and I've got some paw-some advice to keep my food bowl fabulous and fluffy! Let's strut through the do's and dont's of my stylish diet. Ready to pounce on some giggles? Let's wag our tails together!</p>

  <p>  <h1>DO's</h1>
<ul>
  <li>Treat me like royalty with premium kibble! I'm small but mighty, and I deserve only the finest bites in town!</li>
  <li>Tiny treats for a tiny me? Oh, yasss! But keep 'em wee and healthy, or I'll turn into a fluffy beach ball!</li>
  <li>Veggies are my little secret! Carrots, pumpkin, and sweet potatoes make me feel like a veggie magician!</li>
  <li>Lean proteins, please! Chicken, turkey, and lean meats are my haute couture for a glamorous coat!</li>
  <li>Sip-sip like a dainty sipper! Fresh water is my elixir, and I lap it up like a pinky-raised princess!</li>
</ul>

  <div class="food1">
  <p>  <h1>DONT's</h1>
<ul>
  <li>No-no to chocolate! It's like a pint-sized volcano for me, and I'll have a tantrum in my teacup if you give me any!</li>
  <li>Spicy chow is a big "nyet"! No salsa, no spices, and absolutely no hot stuff â€“ my tiny taste buds can't handle it!</li>
  <li>No human feasts in my teacup! Keep those table scraps away, or I'll stage a tiny hunger strike!</li>
  <li>Paws off the grapes and raisins! They're like forbidden jewels that can make me feel like a little rascal!</li>
  <li>Ice cream dreams? Well, I'll bark a "brrr"! Dairy isn't my style, and it leaves my tummy in a spin!</li>
