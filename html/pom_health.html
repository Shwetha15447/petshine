    <p>Hey there, tiny human with a big heart! I'm your pint-sized Pomeranian, and I've got some paw-some advice to keep my food bowl fabulous and fluffy! Let's strut through the do's and dont's of my stylish diet. Ready to pounce on some giggles? Let's wag our tails together!</p>

  <div class="health1">
  <p>  <h1>GENERAL HEALTH</h1>
<ul>
  <li>Woof! Keep me active with regular exercise to maintain a healthy weight.</li>
  <li>Don't forget to give me nutritious meals in small portions to avoid overeating.</li>
  <li>Regular visits to the vet are a must for vaccinations and check-ups.</li>
  <li>Brush my luxurious fur regularly to keep it clean and tangle-free.</li>
  <li>Show me love and attention, and I'll be a happy and healthy little fluffball!</li>
</ul>

  <p>  <h1>DEVIATION FROM GENERAL HEALTH</h1>
<ul>
  <li>Oh no, don't feed me those tempting chocolates! They're a big no-no for pups like me.</li>
  <li>Achoo! Keep me away from secondhand smoke and toxic fumes; they really mess with my health.</li>
  <li>Watch out for those pesky ticks and fleas – they're like unwelcome party crashers!</li>
  <li>Steer clear of too much heat or cold; my tiny body isn't a fan of extreme temperatures.</li>
  <li>Whew! Stress can be ruff, so keep the belly rubs coming to keep me calm and happy.</li>
</ul>
</p>
  </div>
<br>
<br>

  <div class="health1">
  <p>  <h1>PRECAUTIONS</h1>
<ul>
  <li>When it's hot outside, find some shade – I'm no fan of roasting like a potato.</li>
  <li>Hide those household chemicals away; I'm not into taste-testing dangerous stuff.</li>
  <li>Let's paw-ty responsibly – keep chocolate, alcohol, and other doggie no-nos out of reach!</li>
  <li>Keep an eye out for any sudden changes in my behavior, I might be trying to tell you something.</li>
  <li>Oh, and one more thing – keep those shoes hidden! I can't resist chewing on them</li>
</ul>
</p>
  </div>
  <br>
  <br>

  <div class="health1">
  <p>  <h1>CURES</h1>
  <ul>
  <li>Feeling down? A cuddle session with me is the ultimate mood-booster!</li>
  <li>To soothe an upset tummy, a bit of rice and boiled chicken should do the trick.</li>
  <li>Bath time got me all tangled up? Use some conditioner to detangle my fur, and I'll be ready to strut my stuff.</li>
  <li>If those nasty fleas are attacking, a flea bath is like my superhero power-up.</li>
  <li>Remember, laughter is the best medicine – a daily dose of my adorable antics will keep the doctor away!</li>
  </ul>
