  <div class="food">
<p>Hey there, human hooman! Your bouncy, golden pal is here to fetch you some pawsome food tips, the do's and dont's of a golden retriever's diet. Trust me, I've got the inside bark on what's yummy and what's a total "no-bone-o"! Ready for a tail-wagging good time? Let's dive in!</p>

  <p>  <h1>DO's</h1>
<ul>
  <li>Bring on the premium kibble! I'm all about those crunchy nuggets that make my tail go wag-wag-wag!</li>
  <li>Woof-tastic treats? Oh, you betcha! But keep 'em healthy and in moderation, or I'll turn into a furball of fluff!</li>
  <li>Veggies are "tail-liscious"! Carrots, sweet potatoes, and green beans – yum yum in my tum-tum!</li>
  <li>Lean proteins are my true love! Chicken, turkey, and fish make my taste buds do the happy dance!</li>
  <li>Hydration station is a must! Fresh water is my lifeline, and I slurp it like I'm a doggone athlete!</li>
</ul>
</p>
  </div>

  <div class="food1">
  <p>  <h1>DONT's</h1>
<ul>
  <li>Say "paws off" to chocolate! It's a dog's worst enemy and could land me in the doghouse, big time!</li>
  <li>Spicy stuff is a big "ruff no" for me! No salsa, no peppers, and definitely no jalapeños, please!</li>
  <li>Human scraps are not for me! My tummy needs doggo-friendly food, not table leftovers, you see!</li>
  <li>Steer clear of grapes and raisins! They're like a one-way ticket to the vet, and that's no fun at all!</li>
  <li>Ice cream sounds "bark-tastic," but dairy is a no-go! I might wag my tail, but it's not the best choice for my belly!</li>
</ul>
